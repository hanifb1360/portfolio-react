      'In this UX/UI project, I designed a mobile app that tracks the user journey and informs them about the destination and final station.

To achieve this, I utilized Sketch and Photoshop to design a minimalist interface with clear and concise information display, intuitive navigation, and straightforward features. The resulting app is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to stay on track and reach their destinations with minimal distractions.',
